    "selftext": "Regardless whether we are in the recession or pre-bubble era or not, the market seems to continue focusing on AI, drone, quantum computer and a few other topics. There are many news articles about the energy demand and soaring electricity costs. In the meantime, Trump wants to bring back manufacturing to the U.S. and recreate the steelmaking and shipbuilding industries, among others. All those need electricity, and Trump is not a fan of solar or wind. Nuclear power takes much longer time.\n\nIt turns out the electricity companies can be separate between regulated entities and merchant-heavy firms. The latter one is free to expand and negotiation any power deals, while the former may require regulatory approval. The merchant-heavy or hybrid ones are mostly NEE, VST and NRG. I also looked at options for all, which turns out to be 40% implied volatility at least. I bought some NEE and NRG options anyway, especially because NRG reached a deal earlier this year to buy 13GW capacity. One other key candidate is XLU, which is an utility index with 15% implied volatility. I am heavily into the XLU call options through March 2026. As we can see from the recent PG&E news, even regulated entities may have a positive price movement.\n\nCoal is such as tiny industry. Thermal coal firms such as BTU and CNR are performing well. Metallurgical coal firms such as HCC is lagging. There are also some LPs such as ARLP and NRP. I wonder whether I should buy some leap calls on those super-low IV ones.\n\n  \nAnother weird animal is called XFIR, which seems to be a renewable energy LP diverted from NEE. I am still reading materials about this one.\n\nAlong this line, anything else you find?",

    "title": "GRRR, the ONLY undervalued AI stock/ Data Infrastructure stock in the entire market",
    "selftext": "**Gorilla Technology (ticker: GRRR)**\u00a0could be the\u00a0**ONLY**\u00a0undervalued AI and data infrastructure stock in the entire market right with\u00a0**multi-bagger (2-5x) potential within the next few months**. now especially with stocks like BBAI, RZLV, NBIS, APLD, IREN, CIFR, etc all up hundreds of % since April.\n\nThe company sits around a\u00a0**$400 million**\u00a0market cap, yet holds over\u00a0**$100 million**\u00a0in cash, has minimal debt (\\~$16M) , and recently announced a\u00a0**$1.4 billion contract**\u00a0in Singapore.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a new startup trying to ride the AI wave. Gorilla has been around for more than twenty years, working with governments and major enterprises in\u00a0**AI, cybersecurity, and video analytics**. They build the foundation that\u00a0**smart cities, national security systems, and AI-powered data centers**\u00a0run on.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f**What Makes GRRR Different**\n\nWhile companies like\u00a0**BBAI, SOUN, APLD, and NBIS**\u00a0have gained attention in the U.S., Gorilla has been quietly building dominance across\u00a0**Southeast Asia**, particularly through government, security, and telecom contracts. Their AI-driven video analytics and infrastructure are already deployed in real national systems, not just in pilot phases.\n\nNow they are expanding internationally, and that\u2019s where things get even more interesting, because Gorilla is involved in a massive global initiative called\u00a0**One Amazon**.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f**The One Amazon Project**\n\n**One Amazon**\u00a0isn\u2019t connected to Amazon the company. It\u2019s a large international initiative focused on uniting AI, sustainability, and digital finance to protect and regenerate the\u00a0**Amazon rainforest**. It\u2019s backed and supported by major organizations and partners including the\u00a0**White House, Goldman Sachs, AECOM, Chainlink, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)**. These names alone show that this project isn\u2019t just another idea, it\u2019s a coordinated global effort.\n\nWhat makes One Amazon especially interesting is its upcoming token launch, where\u00a0**each token represents one hectare of protected land**. This gives it actual meaning, something that\u00a0**connects digital assets to real environmental impact**. It\u2019s not another meme coin or speculative token with no purpose. It\u2019s meant to represent real-world sustainability value, linking financial markets directly to land conservation.\n\nThe global launch and full presentation of the project are expected to happen at\u00a0**COP30**\u00a0next month, one of the\u00a0**world\u2019s most important climate events**. If successful, this could be far more meaningful than any of the hype tokens\\*\\* out there, because it represents something tangible and beneficial.\n\nHere\u2019s where Gorilla comes in. Gorilla Technology is the\u00a0**primary technology provider**\u00a0for One Amazon, delivering the\u00a0**AI infrastructure, surveillance systems, and smart sensors**\u00a0that make the project possible. Their systems help monitor, protect, and manage the physical environments tied to the\u00a0**One Amazon token**, ensuring transparency and security in how land and data are tracked.\n\nIn simple terms, Gorilla isn\u2019t just associated with One Amazon, they\u2019re building the core technology that connects the physical world to the digital one. If One Amazon scales as expected,\u00a0**Gorilla\u2019s name could become a household name around the world**.\n\nThere\u2019s a video on the\u00a0**official One Amazon website**\u00a0that speaks volume about what this revolutionary project is about. I suggest everyone to go take a look.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f**2025 Guidance and Growth Outlook**\n\nGorilla is giving strong guidance for 2025, signaling healthy growth ahead:\n\n* **Revenue**: Expected between\u00a0**$100 million and $110**\u00a0million for the full year.\n* **Adjusted EBITDA**: Projected between\u00a0**$20 million and $25 million**.\n* **Gross Margin**: Expected to be\u00a0**40\u201345%**.\n* **Global Project Pipeline**: Over\u00a0**$5 billion**, with about\u00a0**$1 billion in contracts**\u00a0targeted for closure by\u00a0**mid-2026**.\n\nThese numbers show Gorilla isn\u2019t just relying on hype or a single project. They have a clear growth plan backed by a large pipeline, major partnerships, and solid fundamentals. That recent\u00a0**$105 million registered direct offering**\u00a0at an offering price of\u00a0**$17.50 per share**\u00a0(current stock price is $18.4 as of today Oct 04, 2025), which closed in July 2025 and was led by a\u00a0**major institutional investor**, gave them over\u00a0**100 million in cash**\u00a0to accelerate growth. This not only strengthens their balance sheet but also provides the resources needed to execute on contracts and expand globally.**A $1.4 billion contract in Singapore**\u00a0alone dwarfs their current market cap, making these projections very exciting for long-term holders.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f**The Numbers Tell the Story**\n\nAt a $400 million market cap, Gorilla already has over $100 million in cash and very little debt. Compare that with BBAI, SOUN, APLD, and NBIS, which already trade at significantly higher valuations despite being no where close in realizing their projected revenues yet.\n\nThat $1.4B Singapore contract alone is\u00a0**worth more than three times**\u00a0the company\u2019s current market cap. Even if a fraction of it converts into revenue, it would dramatically shift Gorilla\u2019s valuation metrics. On top of that, Gorilla was recently added to the\u00a0**S&P Global BMI Index**, which could start attracting passive inflows and institutional attention.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f**Why I Think It\u2019s Special**\n\nWhat stands out about Gorilla is that it\u2019s not chasing headlines or trying to sell AI hype. They\u2019re quietly building the infrastructure that other AI systems rely on. Their combination of strong balance sheet, government contracts, and global expansion positions them perfectly as demand for secure AI infrastructure continues to grow.\n\nIf the One Amazon project goes live as planned at COP30 and Gorilla\u2019s role becomes more publicly recognized, the company could easily re-rate from a small-cap to a serious mid-cap within the next couple of years.\n\nYes, there\u2019s still execution and volatility risk since it\u2019s a smaller stock, but the combination of real contracts, credible partners, and meaningful global initiatives makes it feel like a hidden gem that the market hasn\u2019t priced in yet.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f**Why the Market Hasn\u2019t Caught On Yet**\n\nA big reason why\u00a0**GRRR is still so heavily discounted**\u00a0comes down to perception. It\u2019s\u00a0**not a U.S. company**, and most of its major customers are\u00a0**in Asia**, which makes a lot of U.S. investors skeptical by default. People assume anything based in Asia with large government contracts can\u2019t be fully trusted or verified, so the market automatically prices in a heavy \u201crisk discount.\u201d\n\nThere have also been\u00a0**fraud allegations**\u00a0floating around earlier this year from\u00a0**short-seller reports**. But when you actually dig into the details,\u00a0**most of those claims have already been debunked or proven exaggerated.**\u00a0The accusations didn\u2019t hold up once the company released more filings and clarified contract details. Despite the noise,\u00a0**no regulatory body has found any wrongdoing**, and the company continues to sign new partnerships and win major government deals.\u00a0**Shorts**\u00a0have been taking massive advantage of this sentiment to suppress the stock price but the spring is fully coiled and it is likely going to go off very soon, particularly when\u00a0**Q3 earnings**\u00a0is released\u00a0**mid-Nov**.\n\nThen there\u2019s\u00a0**CEO Jay Chandan**. Some investors think he sounds too polished or too visionary to be real. He\u2019s confident, ambitious, and talks about connecting AI, sustainability, and global infrastructure, which can sound like fluff to people used to hearing empty promises. But if you look at Gorilla\u2019s actual results, long-term government contracts, real AI infrastructure deployments, and the One Amazon partnership, you start to see that there\u2019s substance behind the story.\n\nJay also comes across as empathetic, articulate, and long-term focused. He\u2019s not your typical small-cap CEO chasing hype. And the people around him give the company serious credibility.\u00a0**Dr. Raj Natarajan**, Gorilla\u2019s\u00a0**current CTO**, previously spent years at\u00a0**Microsoft**\u00a0leading product and engineering teams, and\u00a0**Thomas Sennhauser, Intel\u2019s current CTO and Business Lead for Asia-Pacific**, recently joined Gorilla\u2019s\u00a0**Board of Directors**. Before Intel, Sennhauser spent nearly two decades at\u00a0**HPE**\u00a0in senior technical leadership roles. If you want to dive deeper in the company\u2019s credibility, you can take a look at this\u00a0[post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GRRR_Gorilla_Tech/comments/1jsel2h/26_points_of_why_gorilla_technology_is_as_legit/)\n\nTheir core team includes\u00a0**engineers, AI researchers, and tech specialists**\u00a0who\u2019ve been building advanced surveillance and infrastructure systems for\u00a0**more than two decades**. This isn\u2019t a new company trying to capitalize on AI hype, they\u2019ve been quietly doing this work long before \u201cAI infrastructure\u201d became a buzzword.\n\nSo yes, skepticism makes sense, and some of the CEO\u2019s confidence might sound over the top at times. But when you step back and look at the fundamentals, the leadership, and the confirmed contracts, the valuation just doesn\u2019t add up.\u00a0**It\u2019s a rare case where skepticism might be creating one of the biggest asymmetrical opportunities out there.**\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f**TL;DR**\n\nGorilla Technology (GRRR) is sitting at a\u00a0**$400M**\u00a0market cap with over\u00a0**$100M**\u00a0in cash, minimal debt (\\~$16M) and a\u00a0**$1.4B contract**\u00a0already signed. The current stock price is does not reflect their fundamentals at all. They are deeply involved in the\u00a0**One Amazon**\u00a0initiative, which includes partners like the\u00a0**White House, Goldman Sachs, Chainlink, AECOM, and the IDB**, and will officially launch at\u00a0**COP30**\u00a0next month, which will provide MASSIVE exposure to Gorilla. The project\u2019s token represents one hectare of land, making it one of the world\u2019s\u00a0**first digital assets with true real-world meaning**.\n\nWhile everyone chases meme coins and overvalued AI stocks, Gorilla is quietly building the technology backbone for the future, combining surveillance, AI infrastructure, smart data centers, and sustainable finance to power real\u2011world projects on a global scale.\n\nIt will be one of those companies people will look back on and realize the potential was obvious all along.\n\nAs always, please do your own DD!\n\nCredit to user **rp\\_gorilla\\_ape** for the excellent write up!",

    "selftext": "Please feel free to pick apart my math because I didn't find a great formula for calculating the amount w/DRIP after 10 years to take into account average dividend growth rates as well, but it scarcely seems to matter when the [ETF #s get compared to individual stocks](https://imgur.com/a/Nh52dCb) over the same time period. Bare in mind, I did these calculations several months ago and added a couple on the back end that I was interested in for the sake of comparison, as you can see, but it didn't matter how I structured it. If you take the [most common top 10 holdings of well known ETFs ](https://imgur.com/a/c8T0APf)and diversify with just those 10 you should have beaten SPY and QQQ. The caveat being, of course, that no one had something like NVDA in their top 10 in 2015 but many of the other companies have been mainstays for >5 years. So you would have to occasionally rearrange your portfolio to accommodate the top 10 for your preferred investing style, but likely not by much.\n\nThe second thing I found interesting was [how \"dividend-focused\" ETFs performed ](https://imgur.com/a/DQwfR36)relative to those that are tracking specific indices or sectors. Despite having large holdings in \"growth\" companies that offer very low dividends, too. I think this reaffirmed my choice to use SCHD to hedge against market downturns but if I were 100% growth focused I wouldn't use that one either. I debate the strengths and weaknesses of dividend focused investing routinely, but I think the conclusion is that by the very nature of offering large dividends those companies are going to be growing more slowly. However, by common sense and the data, those companies tend to also be more stable during market corrections. So if you lean bearish then higher investment in those types of companies (not necessarily the ETFs) could still play to your favor.\n\nAnyway, all critiques are welcome and if you can provide experience or data that contradicts my assumptions or highlights important points that I missed then please do.\n\n(Side note: the data I used for the ETF vs stock direct comparison was the actual historical data, not an attempt at future projection as on the other sheets.)",

Took my money out because it started going down and I was just testing something so didn\u2019t want to wait for the possibility of it going up again during the holiday season. Just messing around and reading about some light day trading, so thought about buying a couple shares of those two NTLA and/or NVDA with that AEO money. Read a few articles and checked the price charts, both seem pretty good based on my bare minimum knowledge about investing. I\u2019m also NVDA for risky and maybe AAPL that\u2019s on a slightly safer side. Any advice? \n\nfyi I also invest on VTI through my traditional brokerage account and VOO+VXUS through my Roth IRA.

They are a Canadian construction company contracted to build the world's first BWRX-300 at the Darlington Nuclear Power Plant in Ontario. One is under construction and up to 3 more under consideration. \n\nThe BWRX-300 is a GE Hitachi plant that uses a BWXT reactor pressure vessel, which has further agreements or MoU to be built in Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Poland and the US, total interest between 10-30 worldwide in the next decade. \n\nBy the time any other country approves a BWRX-300 for a License to Construct, Aecon will be the only major construction company in the world with real world experience building these plants. Estonia and Aecon have already signed an agreement to work together on the plant. If you know anything about nuclear, you know it's really expensive to construct. Other countries will want their experience to maximize the economics. My theory is that they will be signing more deals in the coming months/years to either deliver the construction of BWRX-300s globally, or at least provide detailed consultation.\n\nAecon themselves are an attractive buy given their relatively low market cap of $1.6B CAD, a backlog of $10B, and a low price to sales ratio given legacy contracts that had fixed prices whose costs significantly overrun. They've since shifted to lower-risk cost-plus contracts which form the majority of that backlog. \n\nAnecdotally, as a Canadian working in the nuclear industry, these guys are everywhere, and their market cap being under $5B is egregious.",

    "selftext": "I am 19 with tech internships saved up portfolio of nearly $18,000 of high quality individual picks only with 4 months of experience (started in May 2025) in investing trying to practice stock picking so no ETFs (on purpose) even though it great. I only have EF of $2,000 invest all my income into stock market. \n\nBiggest winners (avg entry): GOOGL ($160), MU ($110), ASML ($690)\n\nSemi-winners: MRVL ($60), AMD ($130), TSM ($230), HHH ($70 - Small cap success) \n\nSemi-Flops (not necessarily loser): Amazon ($210)\n\nHM: Broadcom, I ran out of money to buy but I told all my friends that at $290-300 AVGO was undervalued against the popular sentiment, because Fundstrat & GS bought in last 13F filings. It spiked to $360 after earning call week. \n\nRecently, I have been trimming all of my holdings and taking profits. Holding roughly $5000 in buying power. I need help looking towards investing somewhat outside of tech, and definitely semi/chips industry as a whole. \n\nRight now, one stock that really does fit into this category of quality at a good price. I have to say is SPGI (SP Global). It a company that have been well-known to perform well during periods of financial easing conditions (cutting rates). The company has a wide moat that stood the test of time in quality and management. With banks having PT of $600+ ($660 I think) and a fair valuation of Morningstar at $560. Trading at $470-480 is literally charity.\n\nAgain, you could say that I only crushed SP500 performance because I got lucky investing heavy into semi-equipment boom cycle I understand. So this post is no means to give financial advice, but rather receive financial advice. So I would love to hear whether you agree/disagree w me on SPGI. \n\n  \n\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "As the nuclear tech micro-meme-stocks like leu, smr, oklo, ltbr have seen face-melting gains over the last year, bwxt has been quietly rising, presently at 50% up from year start and 100% over 52-week low.  They're on the map but still over-looked.  Are they the picks-and-shovels value play of 2026?\n\nBWXT is a real company with real physical assets, 4,500 employees, 4 operation locations in the heartland of america, former rust-belt towns hungry for work.  Mid cap ($16B) with a deep history and wide-open growth potential.  DOE contracts, DOD contracts, long-standing relationships with both government and private industry.  Fingers in every single pie of the nuclear-power space, including but not exclusively:\n\n\\- candu fuel assembly fabrication\n\n\\- triso fuel fabrication\n\n\\- ***large nuclear components manufacturing capabilities***:   reactor vessels, steam generators, heat exchangers\n\n\\- depleted U fabrication licensing (defense)\n\nUntil recently, BWXT was thought of as a weapons company, as they are the sole supplier for components for the nuclear sub fleet, and their involvement in nuclear power production supply chains was tertiary.  Though DOD work continues to be their primary source of revenue, they have been quietly positioning themselves to be the blue-collar work-horse of the coming nuclear revival:\n\n\\- BWXT is in contract with TerraPower to design and build the intermediate heat-exchanger for the pilot Natrium reactor project, and to make their triso fuel.\n\n\\- BWXT is licensed to generate HEU and LEU from down-blended weapons cores.\n\n\\- Recent acquisition of Kinectrics for $525m, expanding their tool quiver and revenue stream into advanced nuclear tech, safety and engineering services.\n\n\\- They started tinkering with their own SMR design variant, but closed the project.  This seems like a real smart move, since the SMR start-up popularity contest is over-crowded.  Instead they'll be positioned as the engineering and fabrication firm for whoever and whichever SMR design wins the race.\n\nBottom line is they seem to be the company best positioned with hard assets and licensing to cast a wide net and gobble up the work contracts (not to mention acquisitions) for the coming nuclear renaissance, however it specifically unfolds.\n\n***(some possible counter-points:)***\n\n\\- high P/E of 58x says maybe my sentiment is already recognized and priced in\n\n\\- transitioning nuclear-sub fab skills to SMR fab skills might not be as straight-foreward as it looks to my tiny little amateur brain?",

    "selftext": "NexGen Energy (TSX: NXE | NYSE: NXE | ASX: NXG) announced a\u00a0**C$800M equity financing**\u00a0to advance its flagship Rook I uranium project in Saskatchewan\u2019s Athabasca Basin. This marks a significant step in moving the project toward construction and positions NXE as one of the most well-capitalized uranium developers globally.\n\n**Deal Structure**\n\n* **North American Offering:**\u00a033.1M shares at C$12.08, gross proceeds of \\~C$400M, fully underwritten by a syndicate led by Merrill Lynch Canada.\n* **Australian Offering:**\u00a030.5M shares at C$12.08 (settled as CDIs), \\~AUD $400M gross proceeds, fully underwritten by Aitken Mount Capital Partners.\n* **Total Raise:**\u00a0\\~C$800M equivalent, fully underwritten across both markets.\n\n**Balance Sheet Impact**\n\n* Prior to this financing, NexGen held \\~C$371M cash and 2.7M lbs physical uranium (valued at \\~C$341M), giving \\~C$700M in liquidity.\n* Add this raise, and NexGen is now on track for\u00a0**well over C$1.4B in total liquidity**.\n* With the feasibility study estimating\u00a0**C$1.5\u20131.6B in pre-production capital costs**, NXE is now close to fully funded for Rook I\u2019s build.\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\n* **Rook I (Arrow deposit):**\u00a0One of the largest undeveloped uranium deposits in the world, positioned in Canada\u2019s Athabasca Basin.\n* **Offtakes:**\u00a0Over 10M lbs contracted to U.S. utilities, with market-linked pricing structures designed to capture upside in uranium spot.\n* **Analyst Targets:**\u00a0Canaccord (C$16) and National Bank (C$15) recently raised PTs, aligning with the project\u2019s de-risking and the financing progress.\n* **Global Positioning:**\u00a0With North American and Australian markets backing the raise, NXE is solidifying itself as a Western-aligned uranium supplier in a geopolitically sensitive market.\n\n**Investment View**\n\n* Financing risk has been one of the biggest overhangs for NXE. This raise materially closes that gap.\n* Balance sheet now rivals major uranium players, giving NexGen both the flexibility and credibility to move Rook I forward once permits are secured.\n* With demand for uranium forecast to exceed supply by 2030, NXE is uniquely positioned to fill the gap with a world-class, fully funded project.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNexGen\u2019s C$800M financing is not just a capital raise. it\u2019s a major de-risking event. Between strong institutional demand, full underwriting across two continents, and the balance sheet strength now approaching the project\u2019s full capital cost, NXE has transitioned from \u201cpromising developer\u201d to \u201cnear-term builder.\u201d\n\nThis is exactly the kind of step investors have been waiting for.",

    "selftext": "Digging into SVII / SVIIW some more.. since it was posted about yesterday. The quality of the ore was brought up, so did some research into that. So the core zone runs ~0.048% uranium, which is in line with Namibia\u2019s world-class mines and higher than some U.S. projects already producing. The 2024 study showed it could work at ~$90 uranium with ~$48 costs, meaning it\u2019s not uneconomic rock. With 32M+ lbs Indicated, it\u2019s among the largest single deposits in the U.S.\n\nAlso something interesting, is that the sponsor is actually giving up a big chunk of founder-shares/warrants, showing commitment and lowering dilution pressure. \n\nOverall thoughts? Is it worth even a small position in the commons or warrants? I mean other nuclear SPACs like HOND, GSRT, SMR, and OKLO are doing quite well.  HOND warrants went from pennies to $~6 and SMR warrants went to $13 before being called. SMR NuScale (same spac team as SVII) did have one of the largest warrant increases ever though.. so that 60x return was a super rare occurrence. ",

With analysts pointing to C$15 to C$16, Rook I approaching hearings, long-term offtake agreements in place, and a very strong balance sheet, the setup aligns both technically and fundamentally.\n\nAs long as the stock holds above the C$12 level, the path toward the mid-teens remains wide open.",

They are based in the US and are using left over tails acquired from the US DOE making the operation completely US domestic. With the big name of CCJ behind it I can only see this getting more adoption, approval and attention. Eta breakeven within the next year.\n\n---------\nGlobal Laser Enrichment (GLE) is pleased to announce the completion of a large-scale enrichment demonstration testing campaign at its Test Loop facility in Wilmington, North Carolina. GLE has collected extensive performance data providing confidence that its laser-based uranium enrichment process can be commercially deployed. GLE will continue its demonstration program through the course of calendar year 2025, producing hundreds of kilograms of Low Enriched Uranium (LEU), while continuing toward building a domestic manufacturing base and supply chain to support deployment of U.S. domestic enrichment capacity.\n\nGLE CEO Stephen Long stated:\n\n\u201cWe believe the enrichment activities conducted over the past five months position GLE to be the next American uranium enrichment solution. Twenty percent of U.S. electricity supply comes from nuclear energy, and GLE is expected to allow America to end its dangerous dependency on a fragile, foreign government-owned uranium fuel supply chain.\u201d\n\nGLE\u2019s commercial deployment is backed by over $550 million in engineering, design, manufacturing, and licensing investments to date across North Carolina and Kentucky. The planned Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility (PLEF) in Kentucky is the only planned new enrichment facility currently under license application review by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The PLEF, once licensed, is expected to re-enrich over 200,000 metric tons of high-assay depleted uranium tails acquired from the U.S. Department of Energy and produce up to 6 million separative work units of LEU annually, delivering a domestic, single-site solution for uranium, conversion and enrichment.\n\nSource: https://www.gle-us.com/gle-completes-large-scale-enrichment-demonstration/ ",

    "selftext": "If you\u2019ve been following NexGen Energy (TSX:NXE), you might have noticed a spike in conversation lately. The buzz is building ahead of the company\u2019s scheduled presentation at the RIU Uranium Investment Day Conference, where Director of Investor Relations Stacey Golokin will be speaking. For investors, these kinds of events often serve as a window into not just what management is thinking but also shifting sector sentiment and the future direction of the company.\n\nThis uptick in attention follows a year where NexGen Energy has seen significant share price gains. The stock has returned 36% over the past year and is up 17% over the past 3 months, with a meaningful jump of 13% in the past month alone. This suggests momentum is gathering pace again. While recent news has centered around ongoing industry events and updates from management, much of the discussion remains focused on the company\u2019s growth prospects and evolving uranium market dynamics.\n\nThe real question now is whether NexGen\u2019s current valuation reflects all this optimism, or if there is still room for anyone looking to buy in ahead of the next leg of growth.\n\n**Price-to-Book of 5.9x: Is it justified?**\n\nBased on its Price-To-Book (P/B) ratio of 5.9x, NexGen Energy appears expensive relative to both its direct peers and the wider Canadian Oil and Gas industry.\n\nThe Price-To-Book ratio compares a company\u2019s current market price to its book value. This metric offers insight into how heavily investors are valuing growth potential or future assets in comparison to the company\u2019s existing balance sheet. In the energy sector, where asset values and project development drive long-term prospects, this multiple is closely watched by analysts.\n\nWith the P/B far exceeding the industry average of 1.4x, the current valuation suggests that investors expect significant future returns or asset development. However, considering the company is not yet profitable and generates minimal revenue, this high ratio may be difficult to justify compared to its peers.\n\n**Result: Fair Value of $10.54 (OVERVALUE)**\n\n[See our latest analysis for NexGen Energy.](https://www.simplywall.st/company/id/572dd4aa-49fc-4270-ad40-e26fb7d3b56a?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta_company_latest_analysis&utm_source=yahoo)\n\nHowever, ongoing losses and lack of current revenue could quickly undermine sentiment if uranium prices soften or if development timelines slip further.\n\n[Find out about the key risks to this NexGen Energy narrative.](https://www.simplywall.st//company/id/572dd4aa-49fc-4270-ad40-e26fb7d3b56a?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=risks_narrative_cta&utm_source=yahoo)\n\n**Another View: What Does the SWS DCF Model Say?**\n\nLooking at NexGen from a discounted cash flow perspective offers little challenge to the current valuation debate. There simply is not enough data for the DCF model to provide a reliable estimate right now. So is the market setting the price purely on future hopes?\n\n[Look into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.](https://www.simplywall.st//company/id/572dd4aa-49fc-4270-ad40-e26fb7d3b56a/valuation?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=alternate_dcf_cta&utm_source=yahoo)\n\nStay updated when valuation signals shift by adding\u00a0[NexGen Energy](https://www.simplywall.st//company/id/572dd4aa-49fc-4270-ad40-e26fb7d3b56a/valuation?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=multiples_cta&utm_source=yahoo)\u00a0to your\u00a0[watchlist](https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=multiples_cta&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=4058934)\u00a0or\u00a0[portfolio](https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=multiples_cta&utm_source=yahoo&blueprint=4058934).

The current market environment appears highly favorable for uranium investments, with the nuclear sector experiencing momentum not seen for decades , but this positioning makes the portfolio potentially vulnerable to sector-specific volatility and regulatory delays.\n\n1 Market Overview and Uranium Sector Outlook\n\nThe uranium market is currently experiencing a remarkable renaissance driven by global recognition of nuclear power as essential for achieving carbon-emission goals while meeting growing electricity demands from AI infrastructure and general consumption. According to the World Nuclear Association, demand for uranium is projected to increase by approximately 30% to roughly 86,000 tons by 2030 and potentially reach 150,000 tons by 2040 . This surge represents a fundamental shift from the post-Fukushima skepticism that previously dominated energy policies worldwide.\n\nSeveral key structural factors are driving this uranium bull market:\n\n\u00b7 Nuclear reactor lifespan extensions: Many Western countries are extending reactor lifetimes beyond 2050, creating sustained demand for nuclear fuel .\n\u00b7 Geographic supply concentration: Kazakhstan dominates global production with 40% of supply, while Russia controls approximately 40% of world enrichment capacity, creating geopolitical risks in the supply chain .\n\u00b7 Supply deficit projection: Output from existing mines is expected to halve between 2030 and 2040, creating a \"significant gap\" between reactor requirements and production volumes .\n\u00b7 Western nuclear revival: The restart of Three Mile Island's mothballed reactor represents a symbolic shift in nuclear energy policy in the United States .\n\n2 Portfolio Performance and Position Analysis\n\n2.1 Portfolio Composition Overview\n\nTable: Portfolio Holdings by Position Size\n\nAsset Shares Portfolio Weight Category\nDNN 10,000 High Development Company\nDYLLF 22,000 High Development Company\nURNM 367 Medium ETF\nURA 430 Medium ETF\nISOU 5,000 Medium Exploration Company\nFUUFF 5,000 Medium Exploration Company\nNXE 600 Medium Development Company\nUEC 200 Small Producer\nCCJ 140 Small Producer\nLTBR 500 Small Technology\nUUUU 300 Small Producer\nBEPC 200 Small Renewable Energy\nUROY 200 Small Producer\nNNE 200 Small Utility\nSMR 50 Small Reactor Technology\nURNJ 110 Small ETF\n\nYour portfolio demonstrates a significant overweight position in development-stage uranium companies, particularly Denison Mines (DNN) and Deep Yellow (DYLLF), which together likely constitute a substantial portion of your portfolio value. This orientation suggests you have a higher risk tolerance and are positioning for substantial potential growth as these companies advance their projects toward production. However, this comes with increased exposure to company-specific development risks and potential dilution from future financing rounds.\n\n2.2 Performance Assessment\n\nBased on the current information available and recent market performance trends in the uranium sector , your portfolio has likely delivered strong absolute returns over the past year, given the sector's outperformance. Uranium Energy Corp (UEC) has shown remarkable strength, with a 1-year return of 173.32% and a 5-year return of 1,111.54% , while NexGen Energy (NXE) has delivered a 50.09% 1-year return . The broader sector rally has been fueled by institutional recognition of the structural supply deficit, with companies like Cameco (CCJ) gaining more than 50% year-to-date .\n\n3 Individual Stock Analysis\n\n3.1 Established Producers\n\n\u00b7 Cameco (CCJ - 140 shares): Cameco represents a high-quality core holding in your portfolio. As one of the world's largest uranium producers with operations in Canada and Kazakhstan, CCJ offers exposure to current production with expansion potential. CLSA recently initiated coverage with an outperform rating and a $102 price target (representing 32% upside from current levels) .

The company recently announced plans to launch a subsidiary to develop a new uranium refining and conversion facility in the U.S. . With a market cap of $5.6 billion and strong recent performance , UEC offers leverage to U.S. domestic uranium production, which may benefit from geopolitical trends favoring non-Russian sources.\n\u00b7 Energy Fuels (UUUU - 300 shares): While not specifically detailed in the search results, Energy Fuels is a significant U.S. uranium producer with conventional ISR operations and conventional uranium and vanadium mines on standby. The company should benefit from the same favorable market conditions affecting other producers.\n\u00b7 Uranium Royalty Corp (UROY - 200 shares): This company provides unique exposure to uranium prices through royalty interests in various uranium projects without direct operational risks. This represents a different type of exposure within your producer allocation.\n\n3.2 Development Companies\n\n\u00b7 Denison Mines (DNN - 10,000 shares): Denison is a key development story in your portfolio with its flagship Wheeler River project in the Athabasca Basin. The company recently achieved important milestones including provincial approval of the Environmental Assessment for Wheeler River and return to uranium production at McClean Lake . The Phoenix ISR project at Wheeler River has the potential to be one of the lowest-cost uranium mines globally. With approximately 80% of engineering completed and federal approvals anticipated in late 2025, Denison represents a potentially transformative development story as it approaches a final investment decision in early 2026 .\n\u00b7 NexGen Energy (NXE - 600 shares): NexGen is developing the world-class Rook I project in the Athabasca Basin, which represents one of the largest and highest-grade uranium discoveries made in decades. With a market cap of $4.55 billion , NexGen is well-funded to advance its project through development. The company's large resource base positions it to be a significant future supplier, though it remains several years away from production.\n\u00b7 Deep Yellow (DYLLF - 22,000 shares): Deep Yellow is advancing two principal projects: Tumas in Namibia and Mulga Rock in Western Australia. The company aims to become a 10+ Mlb per annum producer . The Tumas project has received its mining license and demonstrated excellent economics in its Definitive Feasibility Study, though the final investment decision has been deferred until improved uranium price incentives support development . Deep Yellow offers geographic diversification through its Namibian and Australian assets.\n\n3.3 Exploration Companies\n\n\u00b7 IsoEnergy (ISOU - 5,000 shares): IsoEnergy boasts diversified uranium assets in Canada, the U.S., and Australia, including the high-grade Hurricane deposit in the Athabasca Basin, which represents the world's highest-grade indicated uranium resource . The company also holds permitted past-producing mines in Utah with toll milling arrangements, positioning it as a potential near-term producer. Its recent listing on the NYSE American exchange improves liquidity and visibility .\n\u00b7 F3 Uranium (FUUFF - 5,000 shares): F3 Uranium is primarily focused on exploration in Canada's Athabasca Basin, home to the world's highest-grade uranium deposits. With a market cap of approximately $82.7 million , F3 represents a more speculative exploration play that could deliver significant returns if successful in making new discoveries. The company's stock has delivered strong returns over multiple time periods, including 141% over 5 years .\n\n3.4 Technology and Alternative Exposure\n\n\u00b7 Lightbridge (LTBR - 500 shares): Lightbridge provides unique technology exposure within your portfolio as an advanced nuclear fuel technology company developing next-generation nuclear fuels for existing and new reactors . The company recently reported strong financial positioning with $97.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2025 . Lightbridge's fuel technology aims to enhance reactor safety, economics, and proliferation resistance. This investment offers diversification away from pure-play mining exposure.\n\u00b7 Brookfield Renewable (BEPC - 200 shares): While not a uranium pure-play, BEPC provides diversified renewable exposure with nearly 27,000 megawatts of operating capacity and 112,000 megawatts in development, mostly in wind and solar . This holding offers some diversification beyond uranium while remaining in the broader clean energy theme. The stock offers a dividend yield of approximately 5.4% .\n\u00b7 NuScale Power (SMR - 50 shares): NuScale provides exposure to small modular reactor (SMR) technology, which represents a potential growth vector for nuclear energy deployment. While not detailed in the search results, SMR technology complements uranium mining investments as a potential source of future demand.\n\n4 ETF Holdings Analysis\n\nTable: Uranium ETF Holdings\n\nETF Shares Primary Focus Key Holdings\nURA 430 Global Uranium Cameco, NexGen, Uranium Energy Corp\nURNM 367 Global Uranium Miners Similar to URA with higher concentration\nURNJ 110 Junior Uranium Miners Exploration and development companies\n\nYour holdings in uranium ETFs (URA, URNM, URNJ) create significant overlap with your individual stock positions. For example, your substantial direct holdings in companies like Cameco, NexGen, and Uranium Energy Corp are likely also top holdings in these ETFs. This overlap increases your concentration risk in the uranium sector without necessarily providing additional diversification benefits.\n\nThe North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF (URNM) and Global X Uranium ETF (URA) both provide broad exposure to the uranium sector, including miners, developers, and physical uranium holdings. The Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNJ) focuses specifically on smaller exploration and development companies, which aligns with your apparent investment thesis but further concentrates your exposure to higher-risk segments of the sector.\n\n5 Risk Assessment\n\n5.1 Concentration Risk\n\nYour portfolio demonstrates extreme concentration in the uranium sector, particularly in development-stage companies. While this positioning may deliver exceptional returns during a uranium bull market, it also exposes you to significant sector-specific risks:\n\n\u00b7 Regulatory risk: Nuclear projects face stringent regulatory hurdles, as seen with Denison's multi-year permitting process for Wheeler River .\n\u00b7 Funding risk: Development-stage companies often require additional capital, potentially leading to shareholder dilution through secondary offerings.\n\u00b7 Project execution risk: Mining projects frequently face cost overruns, technical challenges, and schedule delays.\n\u00b7 Commodity price risk: Your portfolio is highly leveraged to uranium prices, which can be volatile despite the positive long-term outlook.\n\n5.2 Geopolitical Risk\n\nThe uranium sector faces substantial geopolitical risks due to concentrated production in specific regions. Kazakhstan represents approximately 40% of global uranium production, while Russia controls about 40% of enrichment capacity . Companies with assets in politically stable jurisdictions like Canada and the United States may benefit from trends toward friend-shoring critical mineral supply chains, but this concentration still represents a systemic risk for the sector.\n\n5.3 Market Cycle Risk\n\nThe uranium market is known for its cyclicality, with periods of intense excitement followed by prolonged downturns. While current fundamentals appear strong with projected supply deficits, the portfolio could be vulnerable to a downturn in the uranium price cycle if demand forecasts fail to materialize or if supply responds more vigorously than anticipated.\n\n6 Recommendations and Optimization Strategies\n\n6.1 Portfolio Rebalancing Suggestions\n\nBased on your current holdings and the analysis of the uranium sector, consider the following adjustments to optimize your portfolio:\n\n1. Reduce concentration in development-stage companies: Consider taking partial profits in your largest positions (DNN and DYLLF) to reduce single-stock risk and rebalance into established producers like CCJ or physical uranium ETFs.\n2. Simplify ETF holdings: Evaluate the overlap between your three uranium ETFs and consider consolidating to reduce duplication and management fees.\n3. Increase producer allocation: Add to established producers like Cameco, which offers both production growth and leverage to rising uranium prices through its industry-leading position .\n4. Consider physical uranium exposure: Adding exposure to physical uranium trusts (such as Sprott Physical Uranium Trust) would provide direct exposure to uranium price appreciation without company-specific operational risks.\n\n6.2 Strategic Allocation Adjustments\n\nTable: Recommended Portfolio Allocation Targets\n\nCategory Current Weight Target Weight Adjustment\nEstablished Producers ~15% 25-30% Increase\nDevelopment Companies ~40% 25-30% Reduce\nExploration Companies ~15% 10-15% Maintain/Reduce\nETFs ~20% 15-20% Reduce overlap\nTechnology/Other ~10% 10-15% Maintain\n\n6.3 Monitoring and Future Considerations\n\nContinue to monitor these key catalysts for your uranium holdings:\n\n\u00b7 Denison Mines: Federal approval of Wheeler River EA and construction license in late 2025 .\n\u00b7 Deep Yellow: Final investment decision for Tumas project following uranium price improvement .\n\u00b7 IsoEnergy: Progress toward production at its Utah mines and exploration results from Athabasca Basin properties .\n\u00b7 Market developments: Uranium price trends, utility contracting activity, and geopolitical developments affecting supply.\n\nConclusion\n\nYour uranium portfolio demonstrates a strong conviction thesis on the nuclear energy renaissance and appears well-positioned to benefit from the anticipated structural deficit in the uranium market. However, the significant concentration in development-stage companies and sector ETFs creates elevated risk levels that may warrant strategic rebalancing. Consider taking partial profits in your strongest performers to reduce position sizes and reallocating to established producers with lower operational risk. The uranium sector offers compelling long-term fundamentals, but prudent risk management through diversification will be essential to navigating the sector's inherent volatility while capturing its potential upside.\n\nRegularly monitor company-specific catalysts and broader market developments to make informed decisions about continuing to maintain your positions as the uranium investment thesis evolves over time.",

    "selftext": "Case study in Finland by academic researchers finds plan to triple nuclear power by 2050 will cost an estimated 71-84% more than optimized renewable energy while presenting higher risks.\n\nThe study is especially noteworthy because Finland\u2019s northern climate makes it less than ideal for solar power (the optimized system has an estimated 54% wind/30% solar generation). \n\n\u201cHighlights\n\nTripling nuclear power is more expensive than optimised renewables in Finland.\n\nTripling nuclear power costs over 71% more, equal to 2.3% of Finland's GDP.\n\nTripling nuclear power exacerbates local social inequalities.\n\nRenewables meet energy demand more cost-effectively and avoid nuclear risks.\n\nTimely insights for policymakers quantifying the costs of nuclear power expansion.\n\nAbstract\n\nIn an effort to decarbonise their energy systems, several countries have declared intentions to triple their nuclear power capacity by 2050 at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties 28. The expansion of nuclear power includes plans for so-called small modular reactors, intended for electricity generation as well as combined heat and power production. This study aims to demonstrate the cost differences between nuclear-based and renewables-based energy-industry systems using the Finnish energy system as a case study. Four nuclear power expansion scenarios are examined, imposing 13.2 GW of nuclear power capacity into Finland's energy supply mix, with various capacities of small- and large-scale nuclear power plants alongside combined heat and power production from small-scale nuclear plants. These nuclear tripling scenarios are compared to a reference scenario that simulates a free cost optimisation with zero emissions target. The nuclear scenarios show 71\u201384% higher annualised system cost of 18.4\u201319.7 b\u20ac compared to a renewables-based system costing 10.7 b\u20ac in 2050. The reference scenario does not include the installation of new nuclear power capacities, indicating that new nuclear power plants are not part of a cost-optimal system. Additionally, the energy-industry system outlined in the reference scenario possesses fewer risks compared to nuclear tripling scenarios, particularly given that SMR technologies are not yet commercially available. The findings have important implications for energy justice, especially in terms of the significant opportunity cost presented by the nuclear decarbonisation pathway.\u201d",
