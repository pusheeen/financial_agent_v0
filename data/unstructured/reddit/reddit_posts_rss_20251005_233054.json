    "selftext": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Regardless whether we are in the recession or pre-bubble era or not, the market seems to continue focusing on AI, drone, quantum computer and a few other topics. There are many news articles about the energy demand and soaring electricity costs. In the meantime, Trump wants to bring back manufacturing to the U.S. and recreate the steelmaking and shipbuilding industries, among others. All those need electricity, and Trump is not a fan of solar or wind. Nuclear power takes much longer time.</p> <p>It turns out the electricity companies can be separate between regulated entities and merchant-heavy firms. The latter one is free to expand and negotiation any power deals, while the former may require regulatory approval. The merchant-heavy or hybrid ones are mostly NEE, VST and NRG. I also looked at options for all, which turns out to be 40% implied volatility at least. I bought some NEE and NRG options anyway, especially because NRG reached a deal earlier this year to buy 13GW capacity. One other key candidate is XLU, which is an utility index with 15% implied volatility. I am heavily into the XLU call options through March 2026. As we can see from the recent PG&amp;E news, even regulated entities may have a positive price movement.</p> <p>Coal is such as tiny industry. Thermal coal firms such as BTU and CNR are performing well. Metallurgical coal firms such as HCC is lagging. There are also some LPs such as ARLP and NRP. I wonder whether I should buy some leap calls on those super-low IV ones.</p> <p>Another weird animal is called XFIR, which seems to be a renewable energy LP diverted from NEE. I am still reading materials about this one.</p> <p>Along this line, anything else you find?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Moirailogist\"> /u/Moirailogist </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nyxe6e/electricity_and_coal_stocks_nee_nrg_vst_btu_cnr/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nyxe6e/electricity_and_coal_stocks_nee_nrg_vst_btu_cnr/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "GRRR, the ONLY undervalued AI stock/ Data Infrastructure stock in the entire market",
    "selftext": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Gorilla Technology (ticker: GRRR)</strong> could be the <strong>ONLY</strong> undervalued AI and data infrastructure stock in the entire market right with <strong>multi-bagger (2-5x) potential within the next few months</strong>. now especially with stocks like BBAI, RZLV, NBIS, APLD, IREN, CIFR, etc all up hundreds of % since April.</p> <p>The company sits around a <strong>$400 million</strong> market cap, yet holds over <strong>$100 million</strong> in cash, has minimal debt (~$16M) , and recently announced a <strong>$1.4 billion contract</strong> in Singapore.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t a new startup trying to ride the AI wave. Gorilla has been around for more than twenty years, working with governments and major enterprises in <strong>AI, cybersecurity, and video analytics</strong>. They build the foundation that <strong>smart cities, national security systems, and AI-powered data centers</strong> run on.</p> <p>\u2e3b</p> <p>\u2b50\ufe0f<strong>What Makes GRRR Different</strong></p> <p>While companies like <strong>BBAI, SOUN, APLD, and NBIS</strong> have gained attention in the U.S., Gorilla has been quietly building dominance across <strong>Southeast Asia</strong>, particularly through government, security, and telecom contracts. Their AI-driven video analytics and infrastructure are already deployed in real national systems, not just in pilot phases.</p> <p>Now they are expanding internationally, and that\u2019s where things get even more interesting, because Gorilla is involved in a massive global initiative called <strong>One Amazon</strong>.</p> <p>\u2e3b</p> <p>\u2b50\ufe0f<strong>The One Amazon Project</strong></p> <p><strong>One Amazon</strong> isn\u2019t connected to Amazon the company. It\u2019s a large international initiative focused on uniting AI, sustainability, and digital finance to protect and regenerate the <strong>Amazon rainforest</strong>. It\u2019s backed and supported by major organizations and partners including the <strong>White House, Goldman Sachs, AECOM, Chainlink, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)</strong>. These names alone show that this project isn\u2019t just another idea, it\u2019s a coordinated global effort.</p> <p>What makes One Amazon especially interesting is its upcoming token launch, where <strong>each token represents one hectare of protected land</strong>. This gives it actual meaning, something that <strong>connects digital assets to real environmental impact</strong>. It\u2019s not another meme coin or speculative token with no purpose. It\u2019s meant to represent real-world sustainability value, linking financial markets directly to land conservation.</p> <p>The global launch and full presentation of the project are expected to happen at <strong>COP30</strong> next month, one of the <strong>world\u2019s most important climate events</strong>. If successful, this could be far more meaningful than any of the hype tokens** out there, because it represents something tangible and beneficial.</p> <p>Here\u2019s where Gorilla comes in. Gorilla Technology is the <strong>primary technology provider</strong> for One Amazon, delivering the <strong>AI infrastructure, surveillance systems, and smart sensors</strong> that make the project possible. Their systems help monitor, protect, and manage the physical environments tied to the <strong>One Amazon token</strong>, ensuring transparency and security in how land and data are tracked.</p> <p>In simple terms, Gorilla isn\u2019t just associated with One Amazon, they\u2019re building the core technology that connects the physical world to the digital one. If One Amazon scales as expected, <strong>Gorilla\u2019s name could become a household name around the world</strong>.</p> <p>There\u2019s a video on the <strong>official One Amazon website</strong> that speaks volume about what this revolutionary project is about. I suggest everyone to go take a look.</p> <p>\u2e3b</p> <p>\u2b50\ufe0f<strong>2025 Guidance and Growth Outlook</strong></p> <p>Gorilla is giving strong guidance for 2025, signaling healthy growth ahead:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Revenue</strong>: Expected between <strong>$100 million and $110</strong> million for the full year.</li> <li><strong>Adjusted EBITDA</strong>: Projected between <strong>$20 million and $25 million</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Gross Margin</strong>: Expected to be <strong>40\u201345%</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Global Project Pipeline</strong>: Over <strong>$5 billion</strong>, with about <strong>$1 billion in contracts</strong> targeted for closure by <strong>mid-2026</strong>.</li> </ul> <p>These numbers show Gorilla isn\u2019t just relying on hype or a single project. They have a clear growth plan backed by a large pipeline, major partnerships, and solid fundamentals. That recent <strong>$105 million registered direct offering</strong> at an offering price of <strong>$17.50 per share</strong> (current stock price is $18.4 as of today Oct 04, 2025), which closed in July 2025 and was led by a <strong>major institutional investor</strong>, gave them over <strong>100 million in cash</strong> to accelerate growth. This not only strengthens their balance sheet but also provides the resources needed to execute on contracts and expand globally.<strong>A $1.4 billion contract in Singapore</strong> alone dwarfs their current market cap, making these projections very exciting for long-term holders.</p> <p>\u2e3b</p> <p>\u2b50\ufe0f<strong>The Numbers Tell the Story</strong></p> <p>At a $400 million market cap, Gorilla already has over $100 million in cash and very little debt. Compare that with BBAI, SOUN, APLD, and NBIS, which already trade at significantly higher valuations despite being no where close in realizing their projected revenues yet.</p> <p>That $1.4B Singapore contract alone is <strong>worth more than three times</strong> the company\u2019s current market cap. Even if a fraction of it converts into revenue, it would dramatically shift Gorilla\u2019s valuation metrics. On top of that, Gorilla was recently added to the <strong>S&amp;P Global BMI Index</strong>, which could start attracting passive inflows and institutional attention.</p> <p>\u2e3b</p> <p>\u2b50\ufe0f<strong>Why I Think It\u2019s Special</strong></p> <p>What stands out about Gorilla is that it\u2019s not chasing headlines or trying to sell AI hype. They\u2019re quietly building the infrastructure that other AI systems rely on. Their combination of strong balance sheet, government contracts, and global expansion positions them perfectly as demand for secure AI infrastructure continues to grow.</p> <p>If the One Amazon project goes live as planned at COP30 and Gorilla\u2019s role becomes more publicly recognized, the company could easily re-rate from a small-cap to a serious mid-cap within the next couple of years.</p> <p>Yes, there\u2019s still execution and volatility risk since it\u2019s a smaller stock, but the combination of real contracts, credible partners, and meaningful global initiatives makes it feel like a hidden gem that the market hasn\u2019t priced in yet.</p> <p>\u2e3b</p> <p>\u2b50\ufe0f<strong>Why the Market Hasn\u2019t Caught On Yet</strong></p> <p>A big reason why <strong>GRRR is still so heavily discounted</strong> comes down to perception. It\u2019s <strong>not a U.S. company</strong>, and most of its major customers are <strong>in Asia</strong>, which makes a lot of U.S. investors skeptical by default. People assume anything based in Asia with large government contracts can\u2019t be fully trusted or verified, so the market automatically prices in a heavy \u201crisk discount.\u201d</p> <p>There have also been <strong>fraud allegations</strong> floating around earlier this year from <strong>short-seller reports</strong>. But when you actually dig into the details, <strong>most of those claims have already been debunked or proven exaggerated.</strong> The accusations didn\u2019t hold up once the company released more filings and clarified contract details. Despite the noise, <strong>no regulatory body has found any wrongdoing</strong>, and the company continues to sign new partnerships and win major government deals. <strong>Shorts</strong> have been taking massive advantage of this sentiment to suppress the stock price but the spring is fully coiled and it is likely going to go off very soon, particularly when <strong>Q3 earnings</strong> is released <strong>mid-Nov</strong>.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s <strong>CEO Jay Chandan</strong>. Some investors think he sounds too polished or too visionary to be real. He\u2019s confident, ambitious, and talks about connecting AI, sustainability, and global infrastructure, which can sound like fluff to people used to hearing empty promises. But if you look at Gorilla\u2019s actual results, long-term government contracts, real AI infrastructure deployments, and the One Amazon partnership, you start to see that there\u2019s substance behind the story.</p> <p>Jay also comes across as empathetic, articulate, and long-term focused. He\u2019s not your typical small-cap CEO chasing hype. And the people around him give the company serious credibility. <strong>Dr. Raj Natarajan</strong>, Gorilla\u2019s <strong>current CTO</strong>, previously spent years at <strong>Microsoft</strong> leading product and engineering teams, and <strong>Thomas Sennhauser, Intel\u2019s current CTO and Business Lead for Asia-Pacific</strong>, recently joined Gorilla\u2019s <strong>Board of Directors</strong>. Before Intel, Sennhauser spent nearly two decades at <strong>HPE</strong> in senior technical leadership roles. If you want to dive deeper in the company\u2019s credibility, you can take a look at this <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GRRR_Gorilla_Tech/comments/1jsel2h/26_points_of_why_gorilla_technology_is_as_legit/\">post</a></p> <p>Their core team includes <strong>engineers, AI researchers, and tech specialists</strong> who\u2019ve been building advanced surveillance and infrastructure systems for <strong>more than two decades</strong>. This isn\u2019t a new company trying to capitalize on AI hype, they\u2019ve been quietly doing this work long before \u201cAI infrastructure\u201d became a buzzword.</p> <p>So yes, skepticism makes sense, and some of the CEO\u2019s confidence might sound over the top at times. But when you step back and look at the fundamentals, the leadership, and the confirmed contracts, the valuation just doesn\u2019t add up. <strong>It\u2019s a rare case where skepticism might be creating one of the biggest asymmetrical opportunities out there.</strong></p> <p>\u2e3b</p> <p>\u2b50\ufe0f<strong>TL;DR</strong></p> <p>Gorilla Technology (GRRR) is sitting at a <strong>$400M</strong> market cap with over <strong>$100M</strong> in cash, minimal debt (~$16M) and a <strong>$1.4B contract</strong> already signed. The current stock price is does not reflect their fundamentals at all. They are deeply involved in the <strong>One Amazon</strong> initiative, which includes partners like the <strong>White House, Goldman Sachs, Chainlink, AECOM, and the IDB</strong>, and will officially launch at <strong>COP30</strong> next month, which will provide MASSIVE exposure to Gorilla. The project\u2019s token represents one hectare of land, making it one of the world\u2019s <strong>first digital assets with true real-world meaning</strong>.</p> <p>While everyone chases meme coins and overvalued AI stocks, Gorilla is quietly building the technology backbone for the future, combining surveillance, AI infrastructure, smart data centers, and sustainable finance to power real\u2011world projects on a global scale.</p> <p>It will be one of those companies people will look back on and realize the potential was obvious all along.</p> <p>As always, please do your own DD!</p> <p>Credit to user <strong>rp_gorilla_ape</strong> for the excellent write up!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/beachbumjeremy\"> /u/beachbumjeremy </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nyu3b4/grrr_the_only_undervalued_ai_stock_data/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nyu3b4/grrr_the_only_undervalued_ai_stock_data/\">[comments]</a></span>",

They are a Canadian construction company contracted to build the world's first BWRX-300 at the Darlington Nuclear Power Plant in Ontario. One is under construction and up to 3 more under consideration. </p> <p>The BWRX-300 is a GE Hitachi plant that uses a BWXT reactor pressure vessel, which has further agreements or MoU to be built in Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Poland and the US, total interest between 10-30 worldwide in the next decade. </p> <p>By the time any other country approves a BWRX-300 for a License to Construct, Aecon will be the only major construction company in the world with real world experience building these plants. Estonia and Aecon have already signed an agreement to work together on the plant. If you know anything about nuclear, you know it's really expensive to construct. Other countries will want their experience to maximize the economics. My theory is that they will be signing more deals in the coming months/years to either deliver the construction of BWRX-300s globally, or at least provide detailed consultation.</p> <p>Aecon themselves are an attractive buy given their relatively low market cap of $1.6B CAD, a backlog of $10B, and a low price to sales ratio given legacy contracts that had fixed prices whose costs significantly overrun. They've since shifted to lower-risk cost-plus contracts which form the majority of that backlog. </p> <p>Anecdotally, as a Canadian working in the nuclear industry, these guys are everywhere, and their market cap being under $5B is egregious.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Morvalus\"> /u/Morvalus </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nz6pmo/missed_the_boat_on_nuclear_power_operators_buy/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nz6pmo/missed_the_boat_on_nuclear_power_operators_buy/\">[comments]</a></span>",

They're on the map but still over-looked. Are they the picks-and-shovels value play of 2026?</p> <p>BWXT is a real company with real physical assets, 4,500 employees, 4 operation locations in the heartland of america, former rust-belt towns hungry for work. Mid cap ($16B) with a deep history and wide-open growth potential. DOE contracts, DOD contracts, long-standing relationships with both government and private industry.

Though DOD work continues to be their primary source of revenue, they have been quietly positioning themselves to be the blue-collar work-horse of the coming nuclear revival:</p> <p>- BWXT is in contract with TerraPower to design and build the intermediate heat-exchanger for the pilot Natrium reactor project, and to make their triso fuel.</p> <p>- BWXT is licensed to generate HEU and LEU from down-blended weapons cores.</p> <p>- Recent acquisition of Kinectrics for $525m, expanding their tool quiver and revenue stream into advanced nuclear tech, safety and engineering services.</p> <p>- They started tinkering with their own SMR design variant, but closed the project. This seems like a real smart move, since the SMR start-up popularity contest is over-crowded. Instead they'll be positioned as the engineering and fabrication firm for whoever and whichever SMR design wins the race.</p> <p>Bottom line is they seem to be the company best positioned with hard assets and licensing to cast a wide net and gobble up the work contracts (not to mention acquisitions) for the coming nuclear renaissance, however it specifically unfolds.</p> <p><strong><em>(some possible counter-points:)</em></strong></p> <p>- high P/E of 58x says maybe my sentiment is already recognized and priced in</p> <p>- transitioning nuclear-sub fab skills to SMR fab skills might not be as straight-foreward as it looks to my tiny little amateur brain?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dazzling_Occasion_47\"> /u/Dazzling_Occasion_47 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/1nz1a3c/is_bwxt_the_overlooked_sleeping_nuclear_tech/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/1nz1a3c/is_bwxt_the_overlooked_sleeping_nuclear_tech/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Is it worth even a small position in the commons or warrants? I mean other nuclear SPACs like HOND, GSRT, SMR, and OKLO are doing quite well.

    "selftext": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Case study in Finland by academic researchers finds plan to triple nuclear power by 2050 will cost an estimated 71-84% more than optimized renewable energy while presenting higher risks.</p> <p>The study is especially noteworthy because Finland\u2019s northern climate makes it less than ideal for solar power (the optimized system has an estimated 54% wind/30% solar generation). </p> <p>\u201cHighlights</p> <p>Tripling nuclear power is more expensive than optimised renewables in Finland.</p> <p>Tripling nuclear power costs over 71% more, equal to 2.3% of Finland's GDP.</p> <p>Tripling nuclear power exacerbates local social inequalities.</p> <p>Renewables meet energy demand more cost-effectively and avoid nuclear risks.</p> <p>Timely insights for policymakers quantifying the costs of nuclear power expansion.</p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>In an effort to decarbonise their energy systems, several countries have declared intentions to triple their nuclear power capacity by 2050 at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties 28. The expansion of nuclear power includes plans for so-called small modular reactors, intended for electricity generation as well as combined heat and power production. This study aims to demonstrate the cost differences between nuclear-based and renewables-based energy-industry systems using the Finnish energy system as a case study. Four nuclear power expansion scenarios are examined, imposing 13.2 GW of nuclear power capacity into Finland's energy supply mix, with various capacities of small- and large-scale nuclear power plants alongside combined heat and power production from small-scale nuclear plants. These nuclear tripling scenarios are compared to a reference scenario that simulates a free cost optimisation with zero emissions target. The nuclear scenarios show 71\u201384% higher annualised system cost of 18.4\u201319.7 b\u20ac compared to a renewables-based system costing 10.7 b\u20ac in 2050. The reference scenario does not include the installation of new nuclear power capacities, indicating that new nuclear power plants are not part of a cost-optimal system. Additionally, the energy-industry system outlined in the reference scenario possesses fewer risks compared to nuclear tripling scenarios, particularly given that SMR technologies are not yet commercially available. The findings have important implications for energy justice, especially in terms of the significant opportunity cost presented by the nuclear decarbonisation pathway.\u201d</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EinSV\"> /u/EinSV </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544225042720?via%3Dihub\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RenewableEnergy/comments/1nqzc1p/tripling_nuclear_power_in_finland_would_cost_over/\">[comments]</a></span>",
